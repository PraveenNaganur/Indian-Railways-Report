# Operations and Train Traffic Analysis Dashboard

# Problem Statement
Indian Railways operates one of the largest and most complex railway networks in the world, managing thousands of trains, stations, zones, and passenger classes every day. Due to the vast scale of operations, decision-makers face challenges in:

-**Monitoring train traffic efficiently across different railway zones and states

Understanding peak departure hours and train distribution by distance

Analyzing station density and zone-wise operational load

Identifying dominant train types and passenger class utilization

Gaining a consolidated, real-time view of key operational KPIs

The absence of a centralized, visual analytics system makes it difficult to derive actionable insights from raw railway data, leading to inefficiencies in planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing an interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms Indian Railways operational data into meaningful insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for traffic management, infrastructure planning, and service optimization.
